# Rust studies

Repository with my studies on Rust.

The exercices are based on the class ["ead05029 - Fundamentos de Programação"](https://www.cecierj.edu.br/videoaulas/), in Python. I'm doing them in Rust.

The exercices can be found in [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en), and will be listed below.
